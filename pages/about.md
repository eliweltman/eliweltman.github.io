# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **Eli Weltman** :wave:,<br>

I'm a creative and analytical consultant who is passionate about solving problems through the resourceful use of data, human intelligence, and AI. I come equipped with years of experience in marketing, communications, strategy consulting, and e-commerce advisory. 

Iâ€™ve put my consulting skills to work in financial services, SaaS, social enterprises, e-commerce management, and marketing strategy. My experiences across multinational corporations, boutique firms, startups, and non-profits uniquely shape my professional profile, blending a bold entrepreneurial spirit with meticulous attention to detail.

I am also an avid musician (singer, piano, guitar, choir), artist, gamer, word puzzler, sports stats geek (baseball, hockey), newly minted husband, and proud uncle of 24.
