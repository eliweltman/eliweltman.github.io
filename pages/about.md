# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **Eli Weltman** :wave:,<br>

Iâ€™m a passionate and analytical new graduate from the Schulich School of Business (BBA) specialized in Marketing and Strategic Management.

I have a keen eye for detail which I use to deliver high quality, data-driven results, with experience in consulting for SaaS, fintech, and social enterprises, as well as e-commerce strategy.

I love collaborating with people, brainstorming ideas, and innovating strategies to build strong brands and efficient systems. I aspire to work in marketing consulting to help businesses optimize channel strategies, implement their marketing mix, and execute with excellence.
